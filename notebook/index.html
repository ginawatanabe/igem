            <p>	The CR2 Gag-Protease-RT construct consists of a consensus sequence produced from 171 sequences of this Zea mays centromere retrotransposon (CR) subfamily and includes the conserved gag, protease, and reverse transcriptase domains (Conserved Domain Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). The sequences were gathered and assembled by Dan Laspisa. The construct contains N-terminal and C-terminal 8-histidine tags followed by a TEV cleavage site for later nickel resin purification and was cloned into the pET14b vector (GenScript) using NcoI and BamHI. Ryan performed transformations into DH5-alpha and BL21 cells for long term plasmid storage and expression respectively. </p>

            <p>A plasmid extraction was performed by Shelby, Fernanda, and John from CR2 Gag-Protease-RT BL21 cells that were grown overnight to send to sequencing with primers flanking our insert and internal primers. The sequencing machine was expected to yield ~500-800 readable bases, thus, internal primers were ordered to cover the gaps. Initially, an incorrectly labelled buffer was added during plasmid extraction so DNA concentration was low (5 ng/ ul). However, there was enough supernatant to try it again. After Nanodrop Quantification, a much higher DNA concentration (70-90 ng/ul) was obtained. PCR tubes were then prepared with DNA, primers (T7F, T7R, Internal GagF, Internal GagR), and PCR grade H20 and submitted it to the sequencing lab on campus. We set up overnight cultures of colonies 1, 2, and 3 for induction the next morning. </p>

            <p>A 4-hour induction at 28C or 37C with 0.5 mM or 1 mM IPTG was performed by Gina and later run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel by Emily. The 28C gel revealed higher intensity bands slightly under the 100 kDa ladder band which corresponded to the ~90 kDa full polyprotein. At 37C, little to no polyprotein expression could be differentiated between uninduced and induced cells. </p>

            <p>Gina and Jon performed an insoluble protein purification of CR2 Gag-Protease-RT containing cells using nickel-resin, Lysis Equilibrium Wash buffer, and elution buffer. A 15% SDS-PAGE gel revealed ~90 kDa, ~75 kDa, and ~50 kDa fragments corresponding to the expected degradation fragments from our polyprotein. An insoluble protein purification without lysozyme was performed by Gina as lysozyme was observed to have a similar molecular weight to the protease. The fractions of this purification were run on a tricine gel in the hopes of being able to observe the smaller ~10-23 kDa fragments. However, this was the first time our lab performed a tricine gel run and experimental protocols were used.
            The Tricine gel experiment was unsuccessful in separating the protease and the smaller RT protein. This may have been due to the modifications made to Haider et al., 2012’s protocols, such as running the gel at 70 V stacking and 150 V running rather than the continuous 125-150 V.  We decided that we will determine the RT and protease sequence via mass spectrometry and trypsin digest rather than redoing another tricine gel experiment.</p>

A 6 hour induction of cells at 28C and 35C was performed a few days later to run all induced and uninduced cells at 3 different temperatures. Unfortunately the bands did not separate well but slightly show partial degradation products at all induced temperatures. The gel will be rerun next week. </p>

            <h3 id="subtitle13" class="notebook-subtitle">Sequence verification attempts of BL21 and DH5-alpha cells </h3>
            <p>	Our previous internal primers could not completely cover the full length CR2 Gag-Protease-RT sequence. New internal primers were ordered to sequence our entire ~2 kb insert and used in our sequencing reactions. Initial overnight cultures of DH5-alpha yielded low concentration of DNA, thus, another plasmid prep was run the next day. Plasmid extraction of BL21 cells were sent to sequencing with the new primers. Unfortunately, chromatogram results did not yield the ~500-800 bp expected from the sequencing machine. In order to continue the team’s efforts and ensure better results, Jon took on the task of verifying sequences and will investigate the reason for our poor sequencing results. </p>

            <p>Another SDS-PAGE gel was made to run induced cultures from last week. The resolution obtained was much better, possibly meaning that the person who made the gel last week may have added incorrect reagent amounts. In this gel, a ~50 kDa band appears to be present in 20C and 28C induced cultures, while a stronger ~90 kDa band is observed in the 28C induced cultures. At 35C, there seems to be no difference between induced and uninduced cultures. This may be due to nonspecific cleavage or higher activity of the protease at this temperature.</p>

            <p>	Mass spectrometry results came in from Taplin! Fragments were annotated on the sequence file and revealed a protease cleavage site downstream of the nucleocapsid. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the second protease cleavage site through this data. However, the team decided to move forward into the next major experiment - determining the presence of VLPs in various polyproteins. These polyproteins would consist of combinations of the domains with both determined and putative protease cut sites.  The team is beginning to seriously consider dynamic light scattering, split proteins, and other equipment for VLP assessment and debated Gibson vs. Biobrick for the initial assembly of parts. Jon and Fernanda sent the PCR products to sequencing and had a discussion with the sequencer to investigate why sequencing chromatograms were not coming out as expected.</p>

            <p>Tryptic fragments for each band were mapped onto the CR2 Gag-Protease-RT GenScript construct using fragment data copied from the Taplin results page into an Excel sheet and sorted by position. The 100 kDa fragments covered 90.04 kDa, the 75 kDa fragments covered 56.76 kDa, and the 50 kDa fragments covered 47.88 kDa of the full construct. These fragments confirmed a protease cleavage site downstream of the nucleocapsid in the form of an 18 bp gap between the end of the last 50 kDa fragment (6 bp upstream of the 3’ end of the CCHC Zinc Finger domain) and the beginning of the next 75 kDa and 100 kDa fragments (12bp after the 3’ end of the CCHC Zinc Finger). The second cleavage site between the protease and reverse transcriptase domains could not be identified as the 75 kDa fragments did not exceed 56.76 kDa, with the most upstream protease cut site observed being located well within the protease domain. This possibly suggests that either the wrong band was excised from the PAGE gel or that the protease has auto digestive activity under the conditions used.

This week, the team researched possible split reporter proteins and conducted a literature search on potential colorimetric assays. </p>

While surveying other teams, we also stumbled on split reporter parts from the 2017 Wageningen Wiki and sent an inquiry to Abigail, our iGEM HQ representative, about how we could obtain the parts. </p>

            <p>	Previous induction and gel runs for the protease experiment were performed in parts by various team members on different days of the week. This may have contributed to our unclear results on the effect of induction temperature on protease activity. To eliminate these variables, a 200 mL 20 C, 28 C, and 35 C induction and same day SDS-PAGE run was performed by one team member. Dr. Robert Paull graciously granted the team access to a third shaking incubator to perform our three inductions all at the same time. Three autoclaved 500 mL flasks covered with layers of aluminum foil were used for induction of the 200 mL cultures and 50 mL falcon tubes were used to grow the uninduced cells. The bands visible on the 15% SDS-PAGE gel conducted on the same day of the induction confirms that 20C is best for producing the full length gag protein (50 kDa),  28C is best for producing the full length CR2 Gag-Protease-RT polyprotein and 35C produces less protein than at any other temperature we have induced with so far.
            </p>

            <h3 id="subtitle23" class="notebook-subtitle">Wiki Survey </h3>
            <p>	The team divided the 342 team wikis into ~50 wikis to scan per person. We found that some teams were working on nanocompartments and using capsid proteins, but no other team was working with retrotransposons or looking to express virus-like particles (VLPs). Some teams were thinking of using split reporter systems, however, many of the descriptions were still slightly vague. Although we were not able to find anything extremely similar to our own project, It was interesting to see all the different ideas that other teams came up with to tackle their problem. </p>

            <h3 id="subtitle24" class="notebook-subtitle">Polyprotein combinations and primer ordering </h3>
            <p>	After filtering through a list of all possible combinations of domains, purification tags, and reporter sequences that would make up our polyprotein, the team decided on an initial list of polyproteins to assemble. We decided to amplify this off of the existing CR2 Gag-Protease-RT construct. Thus, C-terminal purification tag constructs would need to be amplified in fragments, then ligated through Gibson Assembly. We then spent an afternoon together creating regular and Gibson primers for PCR amplification of our pieces and subsequent Gibson assembly next week. </p>

            <h3 id="subtitle25" class="notebook-subtitle">Cloning and digesting the pET14b plasmid </h3>
            <p>pET14b was obtained from a glycerol stock of transformed DH5-a cells. A 100 ml overnight culture was made, and a maxi-prep was done to isolate the plasmid. A double digest was then conducted using the NcoI and BamHI restriction enzymes and a gel was run on the both the whole and digested plasmid to confirm that the plasmid was cut and linearized. Our linearized plasmid showed a band size of about 8-10 kb, which was larger than expected (pET14b is 4.6 kb). </p>

            <h3 id="subtitle26" class="notebook-subtitle">Amplifying polyprotein pieces</h3>
            <p>	A PCR was conducted to amplify all of our construct fragments. For C-terminal purification tag constructs, two fragments were amplified: one larger fragment that included the capsid (~900-1000 bp), and a smaller fragment that included the TEV cleavage site and histidine tags (~60 bp).</p>

            <p>	A 100ml overnight culture was done on transformed DH5-a cells containing the Gag-Prot-RT construct (GPR). A maxi-prep was done on the culture to isolate and purify the plasmid. A gel was done on the purified GPR construct with the plasmid to confirm plasmid presence. Nanodrop quantification revealed a very low yield from the first maxi-prep (~12 ng/µl) in our 20 µl sample, so a second overnight culture was prepared and a second maxi prep was done. The second maxi-prep yielded a 20 µl sample that was 136 ng/µl.</p>

            <p>	We conducted one set of transformations in DH5a and BL21 and another of DH5a on both commercial and homemade competent cells. The first transformation used ligation reactions with 8.4 ng of vector and the second transformation used ligation reactions with 21.5 ng of vector. Our observations were as follows. </p>
            <p><strong>Transformation 1 - BL21 and DH5a with ligation reactions containing 8.4 ng of vector</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>2 large white colonies on positive control plate with commercial BL21 cells</li>
              <li>Numerous small white scattered colonies on positive control plate with commercial DH5a cells</li>
              <li>Few white colonies with smaller satellite colonies on positive control plate with homemade DH5a cells</li>
              <li>No colony growth on negative controls</li>

            <p>A colony PCR was run to verify that colonies contain correct insert sizes for constructs 1, 2, and 3. The first 8 colonies were run on a 1.5% agarose gel. Only one colony per construct seemed to contain an insert ~200-300 bp lower than the expected size. The gel appeared to contain aberrations that may have contributed to the unexpected result.

Only 2 colonies were present with the 45 second transformation, while 100+ colonies appeared on the 30 second and 40+ colonies appeared on the 20 second plate.

No colonies are observed on any of our plates, indicating that the transformation protocol was conducted incorrectly, ligation was unsuccessful, the PCR produced insufficient amplicons, or the digestion did not work. We previously verified that our RE digest indeed cuts correctly. Ligation and transformation were previously optimized and produced colonies on other constructs. This led us to investigate the PCR itself. The PCR for these constructs is conducted in two steps to add the C-terminal purification tag through the primer. </p>

            <p>	We purified N-terminal purification tagged proteins and obtained nanodrop readings of 0.66 mg/ml - 1.44 mg/ml for all purified proteins. We will begin to assemble VLPs using these proteins by subjecting them to dialysis buffers of different compositions. Our assays will test for the effects of salt concentration and pH on VLP assembly and if VLP formation is affected by the different CA cut sites or by the addition of a few extra amino acids at the end of our proteins. </p>
